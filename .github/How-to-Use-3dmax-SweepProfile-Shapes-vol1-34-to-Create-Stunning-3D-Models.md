## What are Sweep-Profile Shapes?
 
Sweep-Profile Shapes are custom shapes that you can use with the Sweep modifier in 3dmax. The Sweep modifier allows you to extrude a shape along a spline or a path, creating a solid geometry. You can control the scale, rotation, twist, and alignment of the shape along the path, as well as apply different materials and mapping coordinates.
 
Sweep-Profile Shapes are useful for creating objects that have a consistent cross-section along a curved or irregular path, such as pipes, cables, ropes, rails, moldings, trims, and more. You can also use them to create organic and abstract shapes that would be difficult to model otherwise.
 
## How to Use 3dmax Sweep-Profile Shapes vol.1 34
 
To use 3dmax Sweep-Profile Shapes vol.1 34, you need to have 3dmax installed on your computer. You can download the collection of shapes from [here](https://www.turbosquid.com/FullPreview/Index.cfm/ID/1737349) for a small fee. Once you have downloaded the file, unzip it and copy the folder named "Sweep-Profile Shapes vol.1" to your 3dmax installation directory (usually C:\Program Files\Autodesk\3ds Max\shapes).
 
Now you are ready to use the shapes in your 3dmax projects. To do so, follow these steps:
 
1. Create a spline or a path that you want to sweep the shape along. You can use any of the spline tools in 3dmax, such as Line, Arc, Circle, Rectangle, etc.
2. Select the spline or path and go to the Modify panel. Under the Modifier List, select Sweep.
3. In the Sweep Parameters rollout, click on the Custom Shape button and browse to the folder where you copied the Sweep-Profile Shapes vol.1.
4. Select one of the shapes from the list and click Open. You will see the shape appear in the viewport along the spline or path.
5. Adjust the settings in the Sweep Parameters rollout to modify the shape as you like. You can change the scale, rotation, twist, alignment, material ID, mapping coordinates, and more.
6. If you want to use more than one shape along the same spline or path, you can add segments to the spline or path and assign different shapes to each segment using the Segment Shape button in the Sweep Parameters rollout.

## Examples of What You Can Create with 3dmax Sweep-Profile Shapes vol.1 34
